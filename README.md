# Course: CS 499: Advanced Mobile Application Development

# Semester: Spring 2020

# Instructor: Dariush Navabi, PhD.

**Advanced Mobile Application Development**

Course Description: This course provides learning opportunities in programming for mobile device applications. Students will be familiarized with the special requirements for programming such devices and will gain knowledge of the considerations needed when designing and producing such applications. The Flutter application platform and Dart programming language are used to develop Android and iOS based mobile applications. Course lecture material will cover Dart programing language and Flutter platform, application of object orientated and functional programing concepts, distributed software architecture and software engineering concepts and practices. Flutter features including routes and navigation, stateless and stateful widgets, UI animation, and Firebase Cloud Firestore are covered. Course includes teamwork and collaboration. Students will form small development teams to develop a commercial grade software product. This brings together their knowledge of computer science and software engineering and tools and techniques they learn in this course in a mobile software development project. 

**Course Coverage:**

•    Core Topics:
•    Listing of course topics is provided in the course plan.

•    Tools: 
•    Flutter Mobile Application platform
•    Dart Programming Language
•    Android Studio Development Environment
•    IntelliJ IDEA
•    Git-Hub source control
•    YAML

**Course Student Learning Outcomes**

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to demonstrate the following competencies:
•    LO1: Select and apply design and programming methods; including generally-applicable high-level programming language control and data structures and data analysis techniques pertinent to mobile graphical user interfaces;
•    LO2: Select and synthesize algorithms, data structures with features appropriate to the resource requirements of targeted mobile devices in the Android and iOS family of products;
•    LO3: Apply and analyze designs from the first two learning outcomes using the Android development and test environment;
•    LO4: Apply concepts and techniques regarding mobile systems theory and practice in the implementation of a commercial grade software application using computer science and software engineering concepts and practices; and
•    LO5: Leverage and enhance project management and communications skills in a collaborative environment for development of a commercial grade mobile software application.

**Assignments / Assessments of Course Student Learning Outcomes**

Learning outcomes are assessed through a variety of means:
•    A midterm and final exam assess student ability to describe and explain foundational concepts in mobile device GUIs (LO1), mobile device resources (LO2).
•    Exams, individual and team homework assignments and quizzes assess student ability to synthesize and analyze mobile device concepts and methods (LO1, LO2, LO3, and LO4).
•    In addition, team projects will assess student ability to take theory into practice in the mobile application domain environment (LO4).
•    By collaborating on development of a significant software project in a small team and presentation of their work to the class students will practice and enhance their project management and communication skills (LO5).
