**Android Application Requirements:**

Implement a Flutter mobile application modeled based on the Dice App (Dicee Project)
application implemented in the Flutter: Part4 LinkedIn training. Requirements for the
application are listed below:

1. The application will have a single screen displaying five die images.

2. Use Scaffold widget for the basic material design structure of your application
screen display.

3. Include an AppBar widget for the screen display and set its title to a name
representative of the application’s purpose/operations.

4. The application at the start shows five dice with the dice images the side one of the
dice.

5. Clicking on any die image will roll all five dice.

6. After dice roll the application’s screen displays the five dice after rolling.

7. Use unique choice of Material colors for the Scaffold and AppBar widgets
background colors. You can select colors from collection of Material colors
available here.

8. Use a custom app icon for your application for the iOS and Android phone
homepage.

9. Be creative and aim for an elegant and visually appealing screen display.

**Implementation:**

1. Implement your application using Android Studio, Flutter platform and Dart
programming language.

2. Start your Flutter application using the starting project provided for the Dicee
Project in Flutter: Part 4 LinkedIn training. Use the Git Hub link provided in this
training to clone the project form the Git Hub. This project includes the necessary
image files and the required project configuration.

3. Eliminate code redundancy using a modular design. Create functional abstractions
for creation of dice and updating the state of the 5 dice after dice Roll.

**Testing:** Use Nexus 6 virtual device with API level 28 to run your application.
